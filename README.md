# 📊 Student Performance Analysis (Python - EDA Project)

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of student academic performance using **Python**. It uses data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence student scores across **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- **Rows**: 1,000
- **Columns**: 8  
- **Attributes** include:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Lunch Type
  - Test Preparation Course
  - Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand distribution of student performance across demographic groups.
- Identify relationships between scores and features like parental education or test prep.
- Engineer a new metric: `Average Score` and classify performance into levels (`Very Good`, `Good`, `Poor`).
- Visualize insights using clean and appealing plots.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Female students outperform male students in **Reading** and **Writing**.
- Students who **completed test preparation** scored significantly higher.
- Students with **standard lunch** and **higher parental education** tend to perform better.
- A new feature, `Score_label`, was created to categorize student performance into 3 levels.

## 📸 Sample Visuals

Here are some of the visuals included in the notebook:
- 📌 Distribution plots (histograms, KDEs)
- 📌 Correlation heatmap
- 📌 Countplots for categorical features
- 📌 Gender vs Performance level comparison
- 📌 Boxplots for score variation by group

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Perform statistical testing (t-tests or ANOVA)
- Build a predictive model to classify performance level
- Convert notebook into a dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash**
